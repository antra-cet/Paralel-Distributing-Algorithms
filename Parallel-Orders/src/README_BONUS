	For the bonus of the homework, which was to have a common reader
for the orders.txt file, I just changed the ordinary FileReader to a BufferedReader
so that when a thread read a certain line, and by using the same object, then
it is stored the last line read.
	In short, by using the same BufferedReader helps maintain the reading order of the file,
despite having multiple threads accessing it at the same time.
