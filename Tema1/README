--threads.cpp()
    This is the file that contains the main function.
    It firstly initializes all the fields used for the rest of the logic,
fields such as the input files from which we read, the barriers and mutexes.
    Then, we declare an array of utils objects that are used to fill out the exponents
and the pointers to the barriers and mutexes.
    After declaring, we call the threadCreate and then threadJoin functions
and at the end exit the threads.
